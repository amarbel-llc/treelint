# CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md migration as a conformist whole-tree linter (conformist#18).
#
# The agent-orientation file is converging on AGENTS.md (the cross-tool standard)
# and away from the Claude-specific CLAUDE.md. This linter mechanizes the rename:
# the read-only `command` reports a repo that still needs migrating; the
# `repair-command` (repair mode / `nix fmt`) does `git mv CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md` and
# leaves a relative CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md back-compat symlink. Idempotent and
# conflict-safe (never clobbers a divergent AGENTS.md).
#
# Whole-tree check (passes-files=false): runs once at the tree root, gated on a
# CLAUDE.md being present. Uses writeShellApplication so the scripts' shebangs are
# patched for the sandbox (cf. conformist#19). Lives in the impure self-check lane
# (nix/conformist-impure.nix): repair needs a live .git, and the check must see
# the real CLAUDE.md symlink in the working tree, not a /nix/store source copy.
